# sudoku_solver_backtracking
This is a Sudoku solver which uses a backtracking algorithm to brute force the solution.

I created this Sudoku solver to get a better understanding of writting a backtracking algorithm. 
My hope is that I'm able to use a backtracking algorithm to solve a schedualing problem, which
i work on in this barshift planner project https://github.com/TK-IT/barplan.
